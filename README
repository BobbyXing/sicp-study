Solutions for problems from the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

Primary language for solving the problems will be Clojure but there planning
on solving some problems in other languages as the urge rises.

The Clojure code should not necessarily be taken as idiomatic Clojure.
There are numerous examples which could be improved by using more
of Clojure's features.

Choosing Clojure to work through the problems was more of a choice
to do the exercises in a language I plan on spending more time after
the book is complete. The goal was not to strive for using specific
Clojure features to solve SICP problems.
