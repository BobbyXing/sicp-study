; Exercise 3.32

; I'm having a hard time seeing how it matters.  I can see from their example
; in the book that the output signal would switch to 1 when it really should not.

; Unfortunately I'm having a difficult time seeing how if instead of going from
; 0,1 to 1,0 if the inputs changed from 1,0 to 0,1 how the same problem wouldn't
; happen with the first in, first out behavior of using queues.

; Unless there is a way to make every action happen at the same time, I have a hard
; time seeing how this type of race condition is fixable. (that may be whiskey talking)
