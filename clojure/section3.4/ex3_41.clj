; Exercise 3.41

; I disagree with Ben Bitdiddle.
; I believe that allowing any one to look at the balance at anytime through
; the dispatch function while a deposit or withdraw is going on is alright.
; The potential to screw up the actual value in the account does not exist
; as viewing the balance is only viewing. Sure you may view in the middle
; of a transaction but that is not wrong, in that instant the account has
; that amount of money.
